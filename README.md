# ShortenIt
ShortenIt is a tweak for jailbroken iOS devices that allows a user to instantly shorten a URL. ShortenIt adds a custom button to the context menu where Copy, Cut, and Paste options are. By tapping this button, the tweak posts a request to a YOURLS api instance and copies the shortend URL to their clipboard.

Should support iOS 11-14, maybe lower.
